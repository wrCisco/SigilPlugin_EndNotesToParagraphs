# SigilPlugin_EndNotesToParagraphs
In an epub, transforms an ordered list of endnotes in static numbered paragraphs, adds backlinks from notes to references, updates css

This plugin has been tested with Sigil v. 0.8.6 on Windows 7 and Ubuntu 15.04 (both 64 bit). I see no reason why it shouldn't work on Mac, though.
